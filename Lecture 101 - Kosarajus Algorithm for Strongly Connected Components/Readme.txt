You are given an unweighted directed graph having 'V' vertices and 'E' edges. Your task is to count the number of strongly connected components (SCCs)
present in the graph.
A directed graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. The strongly connected components of a graph are the subgraphs which are themselves strongly connected.

Note :
Use zero-based indexing for the vertices.
The given graph doesnâ€™t contain any self-loops.
