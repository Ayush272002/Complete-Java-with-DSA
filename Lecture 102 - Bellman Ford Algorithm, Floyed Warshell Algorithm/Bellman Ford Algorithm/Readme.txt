You have been given a directed weighted graph of ‘N’ vertices labeled from 1 to 'N' and ‘M’ edges. Each edge connecting two nodes 'u' and 'v' has a weight 'w'
denoting the distance between them.
Your task is to calculate the shortest distance of all vertices from the source vertex 'src'.

Note:
If there is no path between 'src' and 'ith' vertex, the value at 'ith' index in the answer array will be 10^8.
