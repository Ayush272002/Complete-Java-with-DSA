Complexity of insertion is O(log n)

Time complexity of search for the recursive approach
Best Case - O(1)
Avg case - O(log N)
Worst Case - O(N) where N is the number of nodes and the tree is a skewed one
and the space complexity will be O(N)

Time complexity for the iterative one
Best Case - O(1)
Avg case - O(log N)
Worst Case - O(N) where N is the number of nodes and the tree is a skewed one
and the space complexity will be O(1)

In Order traversal result of a binary tree is always sorted

Time and space complexity of deletion is
Time is O(h) where h is height and in the worst case is O(n)
and the space complexity is O(n)
