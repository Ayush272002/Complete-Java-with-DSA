Sample Input 1:
2
7 5 2 2
8 3 3 3
Sample Output 1:
2
0
Explanation For Sample Input 1:
In the first test case, cut it into 2 parts of 5 and 2.
In the second case, there is no way to cut into segments of 3 length only as the length of the rod is less than the given length.


Sample Input 2:
2
7 3 2 2
8 1 4 4
Sample Output 2:
3
8
Explanation For Sample Input 2:
In the first test case, cut it into 3 parts of 3, 2 and 2.
