You are given a sorted array ARR consisting of N elements. You are also given an integer K.
Now your task is to find the first and last occurrence of "K" in ARR

note:
if K is not present in the array then the first and the last occurrence will be -1
ARR may contain duplicate elements.

eg:
 ARR =[0,1,1,5] K=1
 then first and last occurrence will be 1(0-indexed) and 2
